## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
unzip( "activity.zip" )
data <- read.csv( "activity.csv", header=TRUE )
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
## sum the number of steps per day
data_na_omit = na.omit( data )
total_steps_by_day <- aggregate( steps ~ date, data_na_omit, sum )
## plot a histogram of the number of steps
library("ggplot2")
g <- ggplot( total_steps_by_day, aes( x=steps ) )
g <- g + geom_histogram( bin=2500 )
g <- g + labs( title="Total Number of Steps per Day", y="Frequency", 
               x="Total Steps in a Day" )
print( g )

# Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
print( meanSteps <- mean( total_steps_by_day$steps ))
print( medianSteps <- median( total_steps_by_day$steps ))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
